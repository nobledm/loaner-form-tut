    Or at least some interesting features that could be included when dealing
    with forms on a device with touch capabilities. In this case, a phone.


    This tutorial will cover the creation of a simple form which makes use of the typical fields like inputs, textareas, and checkboxes, but also dealing with the camera and canvas features of mobile devices. Submission of the form will be handled by an email containing all of the entered information.
intro:
  heading: Before We Start
  text: For this tutorial we will be using Android Studio (java), so make sure you
    have that installed and either have an emulator setup or the appropriate
    drivers (if necessary) for running on an actual phone. If on an emulator you
    may need to format the virtual SD card and setup email.
